# parkinsons-fog-net
This project explores deep learning techniques to predict the occurrence of Freezing of Gait (FOG) events in individuals with Parkinson's Disease using a novel Multimodal Dataset of Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease. The goal is to identify FOG events from time-series biometric data (EEG, EMG, ECG, skin conductance) by implementing and evaluating various deep learning models. The best-performing model, InceptionTime, achieved a test accuracy of 94%. The project is implemented utilizing TSAI, a state-of-the-art deep learning library dedicated to time-series problems.

## Data
A public dataset regarding the detection of Freezing of Gait using physiological data was released in late 2022 [7]. This dataset contains readings from various sensors reading electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), gait acceleration (ACC), and skin conductance (SC) from 12 patients with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, as well as if Freezing of Gait is detected within a specific timeframe.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
```
data/: Contains the raw datasets used for training and evaluation.
models/: Holds the trained models and their weights for future reference or additional training.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the experiments, model training, and evaluation process.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, model implementation, and utility functions.
results/: Performance metrics, graphs, and confusion matrices from model evaluations.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies required to run the codebase.
```

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in this project. The provided dataset in 2D array format (features x timesteps) was batched into sequences and transformed into a 3D array (samples x features x timesteps) to be compatible with TSAI. Each sequence is labeled based on the proportion of FOG labels within its timesteps, with a set threshold to determine the label for the sequence.

## Model Implementation
We explored several architectures:
* LSTM (Baseline): Long short-term memory
* GRU: Gated recurrent unit network
* InceptionTime (Best performing): Ensemble of CNNs to identify local and global shape patterns
* TCN: Temporal convolutional network
InceptionTime, a model designed specifically for time-series data, was chosen due to its excellent performance. We utilized TSAI's Learner class to facilitate model training and evaluation. The library's high-level abstractions simplified the experimentation with various architectures and hyperparameters.

## Results
The models' performances, ranked from best to worst, are as follows:
* InceptionTime: 94%
* LSTM: 91%
* TCN: 90%
* GRU: 88%
The InceptionTime model outperformed other architectures, providing a high accuracy rate and proving to be an effective tool for FOG prediction.
